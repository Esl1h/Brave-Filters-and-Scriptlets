My personal Brave Browser Adblock Custom Filters and Scriptlets to sync between installed instances.
Some filters to remove annoying elements/popups/ads/chats from websites.

[NOTE]

Filter: just like regex, but for blocking elements on websites. Found on Ublock Origin, AdGuard or AdBlock Plus documentation, and are many community personalized filters list on the internet to add on this extensions (and native embedded on Brave).
