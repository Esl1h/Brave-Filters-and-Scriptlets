My personal Brave Browser Adblock Custom Filters and Scriptlets to sync between installed instances.
Some filters to remove annoying elements/popups/ads/chats from websites.

*Scriptlets:* custom javascript to run on websites. It's like a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script, but embedded on Brave browser. It's a powerful tool to customize websites, remove elements, change styles, and more.
